# TS Poker Planning

On 30th August 2017 CodeFirst's planitpoker.com went down so we lost our go-to poker planning tool.
TS Poker Planning (pending better name suggestions) has arrived to fill this minute hole in our toolbelt. So create a room and get back to work!

It's quite bit rough around the edges regarding UX and design and if your socket drops you're screwed but we're working on it

If you have anything negative/unconstructive to say about using React: SSShhhhhhgobuildyourownpokerplanningtoolthen

## Getting Started

Fork and clone, pretty straightforward

### Prerequisites

Node and a MacBook. Haven't had a chance to test if the run/build scripts work on other OS's, any testing/contribution would be appreaciated.

Installing Node with HomeBrew

```
brew install node
```

### Installing

Install project dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run locally

```
npm run watch
```

Should see a bunch of start up text ending with nodemon starting up and 'Listening on 3000'
There are 4 watcher processes going on at this point; client html, client css, client js, and server js. If you get any errors try to just run it again OR add some timing space between the 4 watcher processes firing up ( see package.json > scripts > watch > "sleep 5s && ...")

In develop environment the express server doesn't cache static files so no need to restart the server if you update the client files but you will need to refresh the page. No hot-reloading yet (Sssshhhhh)

## Running the tests

lol

## Deployment

run the following 

```
npm run build-production
```
before publishing to production server

## Roadmap

Will update this once I find the piece of paper I wrote it on
